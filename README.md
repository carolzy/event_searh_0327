Every social interaction with a purpose is a selling moment. (It might sound cynical at first, but think of the upside!)

AI is reshaping business from the ground up. Soon, we’ll see multi-billion-dollar companies built by "nuclear teams" of fewer than five people.

Since the ChatGPT breakthrough, the surge of new startups has been staggering—many with a B2B focus, making sales a critical daily task for founders.

And it’s not just founders: VCs "sell" to secure deals with top startups, job candidates pitch themselves to employers, and companies compete to attract the best talent.

Selling isn’t just about transactions—it’s about persuasion, influence, and mutual gain.

I have had much fun desigining this application: we are at the mere beginning of seeing AI transforming businesses to be centered aroung meaningful human interactions and valuating true contribution from the innovative, the builder and the real visionaries!
